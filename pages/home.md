## Understand Yourself and the World by Asking Questions

Philosophy explores lifeâ€™s big questions about knowledge, existence, and values. What is it to be rational? What is the mind? Do we have free will? Does God exist? How do we define health and disease? What is the good life? If you study philosophy at Temple University, you'll assess these claims and others through interdisciplinary studies in the arts, sciences and humanities. Philosophy raises fundamental questions about ourselves, resulting in greater understanding about ourselves and the social structures we occupy. Since the 20th century, most professional philosophers contribute their work as professors, researchers and writers. However, many graduates with undergraduate or graduate degrees in philosophy contribute to the fields of law, business, politics, science, entertainment and more. 

Department of Philosophy faculty have special strengths in the following
 
- Aesthetics
- European philosophy
- Greek philosophy
- American pragmatism
- Philosophy of medicine
- Philosophy of science
- Feminist philosophy

- Philosophy of religion
