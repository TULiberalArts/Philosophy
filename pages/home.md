Philosophy explores lifeâ€™s big questions about knowledge, existence, and values. What is it to be rational? What is the mind? Do we have free will? Does God exist? How do we define health and disease? What is the good life? If you study philosophy at Temple University, you'll assess these claims and others through interdisciplinary studies in the arts, sciences and humanities. Since the 20th century, most professional philosophers contribute their work as professors, researchers and writers. However, many graduates with undergraduate or graduate degrees philosophy degrees contribute to the fields of law, business, politics, science, entertainment and more.
