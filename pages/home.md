Philosophy explores life’s big questions about knowledge, existence, and values. What is it to be rational? What is the mind? What is it to be responsible for our actions? What kinds of facts and explanations do the sciences offer? What is the good life? Philosophy students learn to assess claims and evaluate arguments in a wide range of fields. They graduate with the ability to think incisively and critically, to write and speak clearly and intelligently, and to structure and simplify complex information. 

Whatever your interests, the department offers relevant courses and outstanding faculty members. Our course offerings cover pure and applied philosophy; contemporary philosophy and the history of philosophy; philosophy of race, gender, and other forms of social diversity. Departmental strengths include aesthetics, European philosophy, Greek and
early modern philosophy, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of medicine and science.
