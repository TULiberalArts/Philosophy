## Why Study Philosophy?
Welcome to Temple’s Department of Philosophy! We are a small and vibrant community of philosophy scholars in the urban cultural mecca of Philadelphia. Philosophy explores life’s big questions about knowledge, existence and values. Do we have free will? Does God exist? How do we define health and disease? What is the good life? If you study philosophy at Temple University, you’ll assess these claims and others through interdisciplinary studies in the arts, sciences and humanities. Philosophy courses help students develop critical thinking and solid verbal and written communication skills. As a result, graduates in philosophy find success in law, business, politics, medicine, education, entertainment and beyond. The Department of Philosophy offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.
