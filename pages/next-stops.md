## What Can I Do With a Degree in Philosophy?
Beyond the personal satisfaction gained by addressing the most basic questions confronting the human mind, studying philosophy in college helps you develop a strong foundation in the skills you need for success in any professional career. The ability to analyze a problem and argue coherently toward a solution is the most important and universal skill you will gain through a college education. All academic disciplines employ these skills but philosophy students practice them in a more wide-ranging and penetrating fashion. As a result, philosophy majors find success in all occupations.
