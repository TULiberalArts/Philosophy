_What type of GRE scores do I need to apply?_
- Although there is no official minimum, GRE scores of admitted students tend to be in the 70th or above percentile. Higher GRE scores increase the likelihood of receiving funding.

_Does the Department provide financial aid?_
- Financial aid is awarded to PhD students on the basis of academic merit. The Department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and has some Departmental TA-ships to distribute. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for Future Faculty Fellowships. Due to limited resources, the Department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid.

- The Department aspires to create a welcoming environment that celebrates diversity. The Philosophy Department has a strong record of women and minority graduates, and a number of graduate students have recently established a Women in Philosophy reading group. Temple University as a whole is committed to diversifying its graduate population and the professoriate through its Future Faculty Fellows Program. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with the Director of Graduate Studies, Dr. Kristin Gjesdal, if you have any further questions or would like to be put in contact with students currently in the program.
