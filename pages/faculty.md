Templeâ€™s faculty members are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas such as aesthetics, ancient philosophy, ethics, epistemology, early modern and Kant/post-Kantian European philosophy, feminism, philosophy of language, and pragmatism and philosophy of science. Tenure-track faculty teach both undergraduate and graduate students and maintain active research programs. Professors of Instruction teach undergraduate courses only. Retired and emeriti professors maintain connections to the Philosophy Department but rarely teach courses. Affiliated professors have interests overlapping with those of philosophy, and sometimes cross-list courses and serve on dissertation committees. Their primary affiliation is with their home department.
