The world is increasingly globalized, with goods, services, people, and ideas traveling across borders more often, and more quickly, than ever before. Temple University and its College of Liberal Arts are also globalizing, offering students a wide array of majors in the social sciences, humanities, and area studies programs in Asian and Latin American studies.

The Global Studies Program is the latest step in the globalization of the College of Liberal Arts.  Starting in the Fall of 2015, Temple undergraduates can declare a major in Global Studies – an interdisciplinary program bringing together coursework from across a dozen departments, focused on the study of Global Security, Global Economy, and Global Cultures, and complemented by intensive language instruction and study abroad options.


## Prepare For Graduate School

Philosophy is an excellent major or minor for those interested in careers in law, medicine, or
business. Philosophy majors are extremely high performers on graduate school exams, ranking first
among all majors in combined scores on the GRE, LSAT, and GMAT.

## Learn The Skills Employers Look For

In a major survey of American employers, 93 percent agreed that “a candidate’s demonstrated
capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important
than their undergraduate major.” More than 90 percent placed high value on ethical decision-making,
intercultural skills, and interest in continued learning.* These are all skills developed in
philosophy courses.
