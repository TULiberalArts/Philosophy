## Prepare For Graduate School

Philosophy is an excellent major or minor for those interested in careers in law, medicine, or
business. Philosophy majors are extremely high performers on graduate school exams, ranking first
among all majors in combined scores on the GRE, LSAT, and GMAT.

## Learn The Skills Employers Look For

In a major survey of American employers, 93 percent agreed that “a candidate’s demonstrated
capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important
than their undergraduate major.” More than 90 percent placed high value on ethical decision-making,
intercultural skills, and interest in continued learning.* These are all skills developed in
philosophy courses. *Study by Hart Research Associates for The Association of American Colleges
and Universities (2013)

## What Can I Do With Philosophy?

Not surprisingly then, beyond the personal satisfaction gained by addressing the most basic questions confronting the human mind, the philosophy program gives a strong foundation in those skills necessary for any professional career: strong critical and analytical thinking skills as well as the communication and organizational skills to go with them. The ability to analyze a problem into its fundamental components and then argue coherently and convincingly towards a solution to that problem, is surely the most universal skill and what college level education is all about. While all fields of study employ these skills with respect to the particular problems with which they are concerned, philosophy practices those skills in a much more wide-ranging and penetrating fashion.  As a result, philosophy majors find success in all walks of life.

## The Philosophy Major

The Philosophy Department offers a 36-credit B.A. degree program.  The program is designed to provide a solid foundation for various professions in business, government, and professional schools (such as law), as well as an excellent background for the further study of philosophy.

## Philosophy Major with Pre-Law Emphasis

The department makes special provisions for students who have chosen the Philosophy major as preparation for entry into law school. These students follow a path slightly different from that of traditional major with assistance from their advisor. Dr. Paul Crowe is the Director of the Law Scholars Program and the Pre-Law Society, pre-law professional programs in the College of Liberal Arts.

## The Philosophy Minor

The Minor in Philosophy is an excellent way to extend the breadth of your education and the understanding of the world. To minor in philosophy, a minimum of 18 semester hours must be completed.

## Undergraduate Certificate in Ethics

Starting in Fall 2016, the Philosophy Department is offering an undergraduate Certificate in Ethics that requires 12 credits: a required course “Introduction to Ethical Theory” (Philosophy 2121), two courses in applied/professional ethics and a fourth course, either in applied/professional ethics or in ethical theory.  The courses in applied/professional ethics can be taken in any school or department.  This Certificate is open to undergraduates across the University. Paul Crowe (pcrowe@temple.edu) will register students for the certificate.

## Philosophy Courses for Pre-Meds and Pre-Health Professionals

The Philosophy Department offers several courses which are particularly useful for pre-med and pre-health professionals: Ethics in Medicine, Philosophy of Medicine, Philosophy of Biology and Philosophy of Science.
