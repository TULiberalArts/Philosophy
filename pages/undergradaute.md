## Major in Philosophy at Temple
As part of the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) at Temple University, our BA in Philosophy program provides undergraduates with a solid foundation for careers in business, law or medicine. Majoring in philosophy is also an excellent way to prepare for the further study of philosophy in graduate school. Philosophy raises fundamental questions about ourselves and the world, which result in a sharpened perception of the value of our lives and an increased ability to analyze. Majoring in philosophy is flexible by design; it easily accommodates study abroad programs and internships.
