Whether you plan to become a lawyer, teacher or doctor, a minor in philosophy allows you to develop communication and reasoning skills.  In addition, studying philosophy is rewarding, and adds interdisciplinary depth to other college majors.

## Thinking About Law School? Major in Philosophy!
If you plan on going to law school, our department offers courses a BA in Philosophy with a Pre-Law Emphasis. Philosophy majors have higher rates of admission to law school than other majors - they also earn some of the [best LSAT scores](http://www.nationaljurist.com/prelaw/classics-philosophy-majors-do-best-when-it-comes-getting-law-school). Even better than a straight philosophy major though is our philosophy major with a pre-law emphasis. Pre-law students also participate in internships to prepare for law school and careers in the legal field.

## Studying Philosophy as a Pre-Med Student
These days, getting into medical school or entering the healthcare field is just as possible with a liberal arts degree as it is with a degree in biology or chemistry. Humanities majors not only score well on the MCAT, but they tend to do better as a group than biological sciences majors. Gain a valuable foundation in professional ethics by taking courses that include "Ethics in Medicine" and "Philosophy of Science" at our department.
