## Major in Philosophy at Temple
As part of the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) at Temple University, our BA in Philosophy program provides undergraduates with a solid foundation for careers in business, law or medicine. Philosophy majors are extremely high performers on graduate school exams, ranking first among all majors in
combined scores on the GRE, LSAT and GMAT. Majoring in philosophy is also an excellent way to prepare for the further study of philosophy in graduate school. Philosophy raises fundamental questions about ourselves and the world, which result in a sharpened perception of the value of our lives and an increased ability to analyze. Majoring in philosophy is flexible by design; it easily accommodates study abroad programs and internships.

## Thinking About Law School? Major in Philosophy!
If you plan on going to law school, our department offers a BA in Philosophy with a Pre-Law Emphasis. Philosophy majors have higher rates of admission to law school than other majors and also earn some of the [best LSAT scores](http://www.nationaljurist.com/prelaw/classics-philosophy-majors-do-best-when-it-comes-getting-law-school). If you choose the Pre-Law Emphasis, you will follow a slightly different path than other Philosophy majors with assistance from your advisor. We also encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities like [Temple Mock Trial](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/TUMockTrial) and [Temple Debate Society](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/templedebate). These types of activities help you develop and showcase your skills and ultimately aid you in your legal education and career.

## Minor in Philosophy
The Minor in Philosophy is an excellent way to extend the breadth of your education and understanding of the world. Whether you plan to become a lawyer, a teacher or adoctor, our Minor in Philosophy program makes the development of strong communication and reasoning skills a priority. A Philosophy Minor helps you stand out when you apply for jobs or graduate school, because it shows that you have a well-rounded education.

## Undergraduate Certificate in Ethics
Our certificate program in ethics emphasizes the essential central issues, concepts, history and methodologies of ethical reasoning. Available to undergraduates from any degree or minor, the certificate prepares you for professional life by teaching you how to follow and define ethical guidelines and codes of conduct. Completion of the certificate shows employers that you are ready and committed to ethical leadership. Students take a required introduction course in ethical theory, two courses in applied/professional ethics and a fourth course, in either applied/professional ethics or ethical theory.

## Studying Philosophy as a Pre-Med Student
Philosophy courses provide you with a competitive advantage on the MCATS and in medical school coursework by developing your passion for inquiry, critical thinking and analysis. Philosophy courses also enrich preparation for careers in the medical and health care fields by providing a solid foundation in professional ethics. Humanities majors not only score well on the MCAT exam, but also tend to score higher as a group than biological sciences majors. The Philosophy Department offers several useful courses for Pre-Med students: _Philosophy of Biology_, _Ethics in Medicine_, _Philosophy of Medicine_ and _Philosophy of Science_.
