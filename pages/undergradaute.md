## BA in Philosophy
As part of the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) at Temple University, our 36-credit BA program in Philosophy provides undergraduates with a solid foundation for careers in business, government and professional schools (such as law). It is also an excellent background for the further study of philosophy. Majoring in philosophy is flexible by design; it easily accommodates study abroad programs and internships. Philosophy raises fundamental questions about ourselves and the world, which results in a sharpened perception of the value of our lives and an increased ability of analysis.

## Studying Philosophy as a Pre-Med Student
Philosophy courses enrich preparation for careers in the medical and healthcare professions by providing a solid foundation in professional ethics. Humanities majors not only score well on the MCAT, but they tend to score higher as a group than biological sciences majors. As a pre-med student in the philosophy program, you will take classes that explore the ethics and philosophy of medicine and science. The Philosophy Department offers several courses which are particularly useful for pre-med and pre-health professionals: Ethics in Medicine, Philosophy of Medicine, Philosophy of Biology and Philosophy of Science.
