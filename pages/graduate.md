## Earn an MA or PhD in Philosophy at Temple University
Welcome to Temple’s graduate program in Philosophy! We are a community of around 35 MA and PhD students and a cohesive group of faculty working across the traditions of Anglo-American and European philosophy, contemporary issues and historical scholarship. Granting its first PhD in 1971, Temple’s graduate program has a proud history, situated in the vibrant, urban environment of Philadelphia—a city just ranked a number one designation by Lonely Planet.

Our international faculty and student body reflect the diversity of Temple’s campus and we are especially proud to have earned a ranking amongst American philosophy programs with the most women graduates. There are Temple graduates teaching in Europe, the US, Asia, and the rest of the world. In spite of a difficult job market, our graduates keep being successful in securing academic and philosophy related non-academic positions.

Temple’s faculty members are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas such as epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, ethics, pragmatism, aesthetics, feminism, ancient philosophy, early modern, Kant, and post-Kantian European philosophy. Faculty members publish with leading journals and publishing houses, representing Temple nationally and abroad. In the past few years, we have welcomed international visitors from Norway, Sweden, Spain, France, and China, but also US scholars and academics wishing to work with Temple faculty and students.

## MA in Philosophy
Temple’s Department of Philosophy has strengths in several areas of philosophical study. The department has a rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics as Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were in the department for many years. The department also has expertise in European philosophy, epistemology, feminist philosophy, philosophy of mind, philosophy of race, and philosophy of science.

The M.A. program is designed for students to begin advanced training in the field of Philosophy. Students may plan to continue with a Ph.D. program elsewhere, or may be satisfied with a master's degree for personal enrichment or for pre-college teaching. Students who plan at the outset to pursue the Ph.D. at Temple should apply to the Ph.D. The M.A. can be earned on the way to the Ph.D., if desired. M.A. graduates often find employment as teachers in community colleges and in other professions. For university teaching, the Ph.D. is necessary.

## MA or PhD in Philosophy/Masters in Urban Bioethics Dual Degree Programs
The aim of the dual degree programs is to provide (a) Philosophy PhD or MA students with specialized training in the ethics, values, and politics of health in our increasingly multi-dimensionally diverse society and (b) Urban Bioethics students with a broader understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of contemporary bioethics. The dual degree programs blend the missions and values of philosophy and urban bioethics and will prepare students with the depth of training and expertise to enable them to be competitive as they move towards being future leaders in academia, public spheres, and health care.

Students must apply to and be accepted by each program separately (PhD Philosophy application due January 15, MA Philosophy application due March 1; MA Urban Bioethics application with rolling admissions) and indicate within each application their intention to pursue a dual degree. The two applications require separate application fees, but the programs will share application materials. The dual degree program allows the student to earn both degrees with fewer credits than if each degree was taken separately. The courses consist of the Urban Bioethics core courses (17 credits) and required courses and electives from the Philosophy Department (21 credits for the MA and 30 for the PhD). It is recommended that dual degree students take both Ethics in Medicine (Philosophy 5249) and Philosophy of Medicine (Philosophy 5218).

## Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies
The certificate for graduates focuses on gender and explores central concepts of feminist theory and analysis through coursework. It can be earned at Temple in conjunction with graduate or doctoral work in a wide variety of subjects. The certificate can also be earned through a freestanding course of study not linked to a graduate degree.

## PhD in Philosophy
Temple’s Department of Philosophy has strengths in several areas of philosophical study. The department has a rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics as Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were in the department for many years. The department also has expertise in European philosophy, epistemology, feminist philosophy, philosophy of mind, philosophy of race, and philosophy of science.

The Ph.D. program is designed to provide students with a breadth of knowledge in Philosophy while emphasizing depth of knowledge through intensive work on particular philosophical issues of interest to the student. The program stresses early development of professional writing standards and oral skills. Ph.D. students are generally given the opportunity to teach courses under the guidance of the department's Teaching Mentoring Program.

## Teaching and Mentorship
Our graduate students typically assemble a solid teaching portfolio, working with faculty teaching mentors and the Teaching and Learning Center to build their skills as mentors and educators. We encourage our PhD students to pursue Temple’s Teaching in Higher Education Certificate. Our graduate students also run a mentor program for undergraduates with an interest in philosophy. Beginning in 2016/2017, we acknowledge the graduate student’s contribution to Department life with a graduate student prize for excellence in mentorship and teaching.
