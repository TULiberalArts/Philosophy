## Earn an MA or PhD in Philosophy at Temple University
Welcome to Temple’s graduate program in Philosophy! We are a community of around 35 MA and PhD students and a cohesive group of faculty working across the traditions of Anglo-American and European philosophy, contemporary issues and historical scholarship. Granting its first PhD in 1971, Temple’s graduate program has a proud history, situated in the vibrant, urban environment of Philadelphia—a city just ranked a number one designation by Lonely Planet.

Our international faculty and student body reflect the diversity of Temple’s campus and we are especially proud to have earned a ranking amongst American philosophy programs with the most women graduates. There are Temple graduates teaching in Europe, the US, Asia, and the rest of the world. In spite of a difficult job market, our graduates keep being successful in securing academic and philosophy related non-academic positions.

Temple’s faculty members are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas such as epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, ethics, pragmatism, aesthetics, feminism, ancient philosophy, early modern, Kant, and post-Kantian European philosophy. Faculty members publish with leading journals and publishing houses, representing Temple nationally and abroad. In the past few years, we have welcomed international visitors from Norway, Sweden, Spain, France, and China, but also US scholars and academics wishing to work with Temple faculty and students.

## MA in Philosophy
Temple’s Department of Philosophy has strengths in several areas of philosophical study. The department has a rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics as Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were in the department for many years. The department also has expertise in European philosophy, epistemology, feminist philosophy, philosophy of mind, philosophy of race, and philosophy of science.

The M.A. program is designed for students to begin advanced training in the field of Philosophy. Students may plan to continue with a Ph.D. program elsewhere, or may be satisfied with a master's degree for personal enrichment or for pre-college teaching. Students who plan at the outset to pursue the Ph.D. at Temple should apply to the Ph.D. The M.A. can be earned on the way to the Ph.D., if desired.
