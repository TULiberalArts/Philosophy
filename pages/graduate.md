## Earn an MA or PhD in Philosophy at Temple University
Welcome to Temple’s graduate program at Temple's Department of Philosophy! We are a small and vibrant community of around 35 graduate students. Our cohesive group of interdisciplinary faculty works across the traditions of Anglo-American and European philosophy, contemporary issues and historical scholarship. 

Temple’s faculty members are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas such as epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, ethics, pragmatism, aesthetics, feminism, ancient philosophy, early modern and Kant/post-Kantian European philosophy. We have an especially rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics - Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were former faculty in our department.

Graduate students in philosophy take courses in non-philosophy programs at Temple that include African American studies, art history, English, religion and psychology. We are associated with the Greater Philadelphia Consortium and MA and PhD students may take graduate courses at UPenn and Villanova University. In spite of a challenging job market, our MA and PhD graduates are successful in landing academic and non-academic philosophy-related positions. 

## MA in Philosophy
The MA program is designed for students to begin advanced training in philosophy. If you attend your MA program at Temple, you might continue your education in our PhD program or attend one at another university. Some students are satisfied with completing an MA in philosophy for personal enrichment or for high school or community college teaching roles. If you finish our MA program and decide to continue on to the PhD program, you must complete a separate application. A PhD is required for university teaching.

### MA or PhD in Philosophy/MA in Urban Bioethics Dual Degree Programs
The dual degree programs provide MA or PhD philosophy students with specialized training in the ethics, values, and politics of health in our increasingly multi-dimensionally diverse society. The programs also provide urban bioethics students with a more in-depth understanding of the philosophical underpinnings in contemporary bioethics. Blending the missions and values of philosophy and urban bioethics, the dual degree programs prepare future leaders in academia, public spheres and healthcare.

## Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies
The certificate for graduates focuses on gender and explores central concepts of feminist theory and analysis through coursework. It can be earned at Temple in conjunction with graduate or doctoral work in a wide variety of subjects. The certificate can also be earned through a freestanding course of study not linked to a graduate degree.

## Teaching and Mentorship
Our graduate students typically assemble a solid teaching portfolio, working with faculty teaching mentors and the Teaching and Learning Center to build their skills as mentors and educators. We encourage our PhD students to pursue Temple’s Teaching in Higher Education Certificate. Our graduate students also run a mentor program for undergraduates with an interest in philosophy. Beginning in 2016/2017, we acknowledge the graduate student’s contribution to Department life with a graduate student prize for excellence in mentorship and teaching.
