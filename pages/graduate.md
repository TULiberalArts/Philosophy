## Earn an MA or PhD in Philosophy
Granting its first PhD in 1971, the Department of Philosophy has a proud history in Philadelphia. Our scholarly community consists of a cohesive group of graduate students and faculty who work across the traditions of Anglo-American and European philosophy, contemporary issues and historical scholarship. In spite of a challenging job market, our MA and PhD graduates are successful in landing academic and non-academic philosophy-related positions. Temple graduates teach in Europe, the US, Asia and beyond. 

Temple’s philosophy faculty are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas that include aesthetics, ancient philosophy, ethics, early modern and Kant/post-Kantian European philosophy, epistemology, feminism, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and pragmatism. We have an especially rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics - Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were former faculty. Faculty members publish with leading journals and publishing houses, representing Temple nationally and abroad.

## MA in Philosophy
The MA program is designed for students to begin advanced training in philosophy. If you attend the MA in Philosophy program at Temple, you might continue your education in our PhD program or attend one at another university. Some students are satisfied with completing an MA in Philosophy for personal enrichment or to teach in high schools or community colleges. If you finish an MA at Temple and decide to continue on to our PhD in Philosophy program, you must complete a separate application. A PhD is required to teach at the university level.

## PhD in Philosophy
The PhD in Philosophy program at Temple provides students with a breadth of knowledge in Philosophy while emphasizing depth of knowledge in philosophical issues of interest. In addition to two years of course work (for incoming students with no credit transfers), PhD students submit two preliminary essays in their second and third years to gain experience in research, collegial cooperation and publishing strategies. PhD students usually teach courses under the guidance of the department's [Teaching Mentoring Program](https://teaching.temple.edu/). We also encourage our PhD students to pursue Temple’s [Teaching in Higher Education Certificate](https://teaching.temple.edu/teaching-higher-education-certificate-teachers-and-professionals).

## Academic Partnerships and Exchanges
We actively encourage—and facilitate—interdisciplinary scholarly work. The Philosophy Department and the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple now offer [dual degrees in Philosophy and Urban Bioethics](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/medicine/urban-bioethics-ma/) designed to prepare students for practice, research and teaching in healthcare ethics and policy. We offer a Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies in cooperation with the Women's Studies Department and scholarly exchange programs in Vietnam with the [Center for Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture, and Society](http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/welcome.htm). The [Greater Philadelphia Philosophy Consortium](http://www.thegppc.org/) provides expanded course options for graduate work in Philosophy; MA and PhD students at Temple may take graduate courses at the University of Pennslyvania and Villanova University.

## Temple Graduate School Funding
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. Explore all available opportunities and apply early to make your education an affordable experience.

PhD students are awarded financial aid on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for [Future Faculty Fellowships](http://www.temple.edu/grad/finances/fff_program.htm). Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. University Fellowships, Graduate Assistantships and Academic Internships are ordinarily reserved for PhD students.

## Tuition and Fees
For more than 130 years, we have focused on providing a world-class education at an affordable price. Just compare Temple to other universities and see what we mean. Temple tuition rates vary by college or school, residency status, student level and more. Use the [Temple Tuition Calculator](https://bursar.temple.edu/tuition-and-fees/tuition-rates) to estimate your tuition rate.
