## Earn an MA or PhD in Philosophy at Temple University
Granting our first PhD in 1971, the Department of Philosophy's has a proud history. Our scholarly community consists of a cohesive group of MA and PhD students and faculty who work across the traditions of Anglo-American and European philosophy, contemporary issues and historical scholarship. In spite of a challenging job market, our MA and PhD graduates are successful in landing academic and non-academic philosophy-related positions. There are Temple graduates teaching in Europe, the US, Asia and the rest of the world.

We actively encourage—and seek to facilitate—interdisciplinary work. The philosophy department and the Lewis Katz School of Medicine now offer [dual-degrees in philosophy and urban bioethics](http://www.cla.temple.edu/philosophy/announcing-new-ma-in-philosophymasters-in-urban-bioethics-dual-degree-program/). These are qualifications designed to prepare students for research, teaching and practice in healthcare ethics and policy. We offer a Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies in cooperation with the Women's Studies Department. The department is also involved in a scholarly exchange program with institutions in Vietnam under the auspices of the [Center for Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture, and Society](http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/welcome.htm). The [Greater Philadelphia Philosophy Consortium](http://www.thegppc.org/)provides expanded course options for graduate work in Philosophy - MA and PhD students at Temple may take graduate courses at the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University.

Temple’s philosophy faculty are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas that include epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, ethics, pragmatism, aesthetics, feminism, ancient philosophy, early modern and Kant/post-Kantian European philosophy. We have an especially rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics - Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were former faculty in our department. Faculty members publish with leading journals and publishing houses, representing Temple nationally and abroad. In the past few years, we have welcomed international visitors from Norway, Sweden, Spain, France, and China, but also US scholars and academics wishing to work with Temple faculty and students.

## MA in Philosophy
The MA program is designed for students to begin advanced training in philosophy. If you attend the MA in philosophy program at Temple, you might continue your education in our PhD program or attend one at another university. Some students are satisfied with completing an MA in philosophy for personal enrichment or for high school or community college teaching roles. If you finish an MA at Temple and decide to continue on to our PhD in philosophy program, you must complete a separate application. A PhD is required for university teaching.

## PhD in Philosophy
The PhD in philosophy program at Temple provides students with a breadth of knowledge in Philosophy while emphasizing depth of knowledge in philosophical issues of interest. In addition to two years of coursework (for incoming students with no credit transfers), PhD students submit two preliminary essays in their second and third years to gain experience in research, collegial cooperation and publishing strategies. PhD students usually teach courses under the guidance of the department's [Teaching Mentoring Program](https://teaching.temple.edu/). We encourage our PhD students to pursue Temple’s Teaching in Higher Education Certificate.

## Temple Graduate School Funding
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to a college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. We encourage you to explore all of the opportunities available and apply early to make your education an affordable experience. 

Financial aid is awarded to PhD students on the basis of academic merit. The Department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and has some Departmental TA-ships to distribute. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for [Future Faculty Fellowships](http://www.temple.edu/grad/finances/fff_program.htm). Due to limited resources, the Department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid.
