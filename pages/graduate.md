## Earn an MA or PhD in Philosophy at Temple University
Granting its first PhD in 1971, the Department of Philosophy has a proud history in Philadelphia. Our scholarly community consists of a cohesive group of graduate students and faculty who work across the traditions of Anglo-American and European philosophy, contemporary issues and historical scholarship. In spite of a challenging job market, our MA and PhD graduates are successful in landing academic and non-academic philosophy-related positions. Temple graduates teach in Europe, the US, Asia and beyond.

Temple’s philosophy faculty are internationally acclaimed in key philosophical areas that include epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, ethics, pragmatism, aesthetics, feminism, ancient philosophy, early modern and Kant/post-Kantian European philosophy. We have an especially rich history and continuing presence in the field of aesthetics - Monroe Beardsley and John Fisher were former faculty in our department. Faculty members publish with leading journals and publishing houses, representing Temple nationally and abroad. 

## Academic Partnerships and Exchanges
We actively encourage — and facilitate — interdisciplinary scholarly work. The philosophy department and the Lewis Katz School of Medicine now offer [dual-degrees in philosophy and urban bioethics](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/medicine/urban-bioethics-ma/) designed to prepare students for research, teaching and practice in healthcare ethics and policy. We offer a Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies in cooperation with the Women's Studies Department and scholarly exchange programs in Vietnam with the [Center for Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture, and Society](http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/welcome.htm). The [Greater Philadelphia Philosophy Consortium](http://www.thegppc.org/) provides expanded course options for graduate work in Philosophy - MA and PhD students at Temple may take graduate courses at the University of Pennslyvania and Villanova University. 

## MA in Philosophy
The MA program is designed for students to begin advanced training in philosophy. If you attend the MA in philosophy program at Temple, you might continue your education in our PhD program or attend one at another university. Some students are satisfied with completing an MA in philosophy for personal enrichment or to teach in high schools or community colleges. If you finish an MA at Temple and decide to continue on to our PhD in philosophy program, you must complete a separate application. A PhD is required to teach at the university level.

## PhD in Philosophy
The PhD in philosophy program at Temple provides students with a breadth of knowledge in Philosophy while emphasizing depth of knowledge in philosophical issues of interest. In addition to two years of coursework (for incoming students with no credit transfers), PhD students submit two preliminary essays in their second and third years to gain experience in research, collegial cooperation and publishing strategies. PhD students usually teach courses under the guidance of the department's [Teaching Mentoring Program](https://teaching.temple.edu/). We encourage our PhD students to pursue Temple’s [Teaching in Higher Education Certificate](https://teaching.temple.edu/teaching-higher-education-certificate-teachers-and-professionals).

## Temple Graduate School Funding
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. Explore all of available opportunities and apply early to make your education an affordable experience. 

PhD students are awarded financial aid on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for [Future Faculty Fellowships](http://www.temple.edu/grad/finances/fff_program.htm). Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid.
